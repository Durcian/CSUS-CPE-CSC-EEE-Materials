Homework 12: Functions

Problem 1 Comments
------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) After compiling and running the program. I observed that it's
    calculating f(x,y,z) and returning z. The function f is has
    a return variable that is taking the sin of x * y. z is adding
    1.0 to retval. 

(2) I changed the variable type to int for z and c. Also, to float
    for x and y. The error was that it cannot bind non-const lvalue
    reference of type 'double&' to an rvalue of type 'double' 
    c = f(x, y, z);

(3) I've changed the function call to c = f(1, 2, 3). I've added
    integers instead. The error I got was x and y are being stated
    as unused variables. The error that stated about not being
    able to bind non-const lvalue reference of type 'double&'
    to an rvalue of type 'double' c = (1, 2, 3); still pops
    up.

(4) The original output of the program is:
       f(x,y,z) = 0.479426
       z = 1.47943

    By changing the function declaration to double z changed
    the output as:
        f(x,y,z) = 0.479426
        z = 6.95333e-310

    &z means we're passing in a reference-to-double to the
    function. It accepts arguments by reference. 
    z = retval + 1.0 is being passed. Changing the function
    declaration to double z removes this feature. Therefore,
    it leads to changing the z output.
